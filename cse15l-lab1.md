* The cd command, standing for "change directory", is an essential terminal command used to navigate the file system. By specifying a directory path as its argument, users can move to different locations within the file hierarchy. Simply typing cd with no arguments transports the user to their home directory. Furthermore, shortcuts like cd .. allow users to move up one directory level, making directory traversal efficient and intuitive.
