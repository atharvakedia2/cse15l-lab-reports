* The method called is handleRequest in the above images
* The argument of handleRequest is url which is a member of the URI class. The initial value is localhost:2994/, which becomes localhost:2994/add-messages?s=Hello, and finally it becomes localhost:2994/add-message?s=How%27s%20it%20going.

* The relevant fields of the class are:
  - path: This is called by getPath() , and remains unchanged in the screenshots because even though the url is changed, it extracts the same Path as the previous part. Its value is /add- message .
  - query: This is called by getQuery() , and this value is changed in the screenshots. Initally itâ€™s value is s=Hello , and it changes to s=How%27s%20it%20going.

 # Part 3
During the 2nd and 3rd labs, I acquired valuable skills, including how to connect to remote servers using our laptop terminals. I foresee this being immensely beneficial during internships where connecting to external servers might be a necessity. Additionally, I gained insights into hosting servers online and understanding the processing of online requests. I also became familiar with several terminal commands, such as mkdir and scp.
